# Gatsby Bootstrap Netlify Starter

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/konsumer/gatsby-starter-bootstrap-netlify.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

[Bootstrap 4](http://getbootstrap.com/), [bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) and netlify CMS starter for Gatsby

This repo contains an example blog that is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and [Netlify CMS](https://netlifycms.org): [demo](https://gatsby-starter-bootstrap-netlify.netlify.com)

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node (I recommend using v8.2.0 or higher)
* [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/)

### Run Locally

```sh
gatsby new [SITE_DIRECTORY_NAME] https://github.com/konsumer/gatsby-starter-bootstrap-netlify/
cd [SITE_DIRECTORY_NAME]
npm start
```

## Accessing the CMS

Follow the [Netlify CMS Quick Start Guide](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/quick-start/#authentication) to set up authentication, and hosting.

### Configuration

Set your site's title in `gatsby-config.js`. If you set `disqus` to your ID, it will be used for your comments, set it to `false` and it will be left out. It's currently set to `gatsby-starter-blog`, for the demo, but you can set it to your disqus ID. `author` and `authorLink` aren't currently used for anything, but maybe later.


### Theming

You can quickly load any theme from [bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) by editing `src/layouts/index.scss`, and switching out `cosmo` for one of these:

* cosmo
* cerulean
* cyborg
* darkly
* flatly
* journal
* litera
* lumen
* lux
* materia
* minty
* pulse
* sandstone
* simplex
* sketchy
* slate
* solar
* spacelab
* superhero
* united
* yeti

There's 2 lines to change.

You can also comment/uncomment lines in that file to customize exactly what parts of bootstrap are loaded.

**Edit a file, create a new file, and clone from Bitbucket in under 2 minutes**

When you're done, you can delete the content in this README and update the file with details for others getting started with your repository.

*We recommend that you open this README in another tab as you perform the tasks below. You can [watch our video](https://youtu.be/0ocf7u76WSo) for a full demo of all the steps in this tutorial. Open the video in a new tab to avoid leaving Bitbucket.*

## Edit a file

You’ll start by editing this README file to learn how to edit a file in Bitbucket.

1. Click **Source** on the left side.
2. Click the README.md link from the list of files.
3. Click the **Edit** button.
4. Delete the following text: *Delete this line to make a change to the README from Bitbucket.*
5. After making your change, click **Commit** and then **Commit** again in the dialog. The commit page will open and you’ll see the change you just made.
6. Go back to the **Source** page.

---

## Create a file

Next, you’ll add a new file to this repository.

1. Click the **New file** button at the top of the **Source** page.
2. Give the file a filename of **contributors.txt**.
3. Enter your name in the empty file space.
4. Click **Commit** and then **Commit** again in the dialog.
5. Go back to the **Source** page.

Before you move on, go ahead and explore the repository. You've already seen the **Source** page, but check out the **Commits**, **Branches**, and **Settings** pages.

## Clone a repository

Use these steps to clone from SourceTree, our client for using the repository command-line free. Cloning allows you to work on your files locally. If you don't yet have SourceTree, [download and install first](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/). If you prefer to clone from the command line, see [Clone a repository](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/4whODQ).

1. You’ll see the clone button under the **Source** heading. Click that button.
2. Now click **Check out in SourceTree**. You may need to create a SourceTree account or log in.
3. When you see the **Clone New** dialog in SourceTree, update the destination path and name if you’d like to and then click **Clone**.
4. Open the directory you just created to see your repository’s files.

Now that you're more familiar with your Bitbucket repository, go ahead and add a new file locally. You can [push your change back to Bitbucket with SourceTree](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/iqyBMg), or you can [add, commit,](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8QhODQ) and [push from the command line](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/NQ0zDQ).
